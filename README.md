# How to use the LAN Godot Implementation

Setup:

-> go to Debug = > Run Multiple Instances = > Run 2 Instances 
-> open multiplayer_interface within res://scenes


How to Run:

run the multiplayer_interface scene. Two scenes should pop up. 
Label one as the host and label another as the client. Then on the one 
labeled host, click Start LAN server. on the one labeled client, click join server.
Finally, back on the host, click start game. What you should see is two marios that 
can be independently controlled if you click between the two screens.
